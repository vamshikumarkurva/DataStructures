# DataStructures

Following are the few data structures implemeted in c++. 

1. Singly Linked List (with and without tail pointer)
2. Doubly Linked List
3. Stacks and Queues using Double linked lists
4. Binary Search Tree
5. AVL Tree (self-balancing BST)
6. Heap/Priority Queue (Using the implicit binary tree representation of array)
7. Sorting algorithms (Quick, Merge, Heap, Bubble, Selection)

More will be added as I keep learning more.

Compile the programs using

```
g++ program_name.cpp -std=c++11

```
